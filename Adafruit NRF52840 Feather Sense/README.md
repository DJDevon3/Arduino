# Simple Offline Indoor Weather Station
Required hardware: Adafruit NRF52840 Feather Sense board and 3.5" TFT Featherwing.  

I'm using this as a basic temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure display inside my garage. In Florida, on July 1st, it's 95F in here. :/

This is all offline real-time sensor data.

Once you play around with the demo you'll see how easy it is to customize it using setCursor positions for text and variables. Customize to your hearts content.
